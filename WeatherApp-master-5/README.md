# WeatherApp

To deliver source code and binary APK file for a sample weather application running on Android OS with the following minimal functional requirements.-	The app obtains the current GPS location of the device, which invokes a web-service request to fetch the weather for identified location. -	When a response has been received by the calling app thread the returned JSON data is parsed and de-serialized into an appropriate data model. -	This data is displayed on the app UI using a Google Map API. -	The app allows the display of a map with the user’s current location and weather. -	The user is able to interact with the map (zoom, pan, etc.), and after clicking on the map, all the relevant weather data for the user-clicked location is displayed in an overlay on the map. -	Data caching is handled by a worker thread, which provides data storage functionality. -	The app can be used in portrait and landscape mode. Providing an intuitive UI adhering to Android conventions.The Weather App SDK is contained within an Android Library Project compiled as an ‘aar’ bundle for binary distribution.This SDK can be initialized from another app by adding a reference to the ServiceLibrary.
